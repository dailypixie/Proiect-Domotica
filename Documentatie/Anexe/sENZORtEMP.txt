FEATURES DESCRIPTION
The LM50/LM50-Q1 is a precision integrated-circuit
temperature sensor that can sense a −40°C to (Centigrade)
+125°C temperature range using a single positive supply. The LM50/LM50-Q1's output voltage is
linearly proportional to Celsius (Centigrade) temperature (+10 mV/°C) and has a DC offset of 
+500 mV. The offset allows reading negative temperatures without the need for a negative supply.
